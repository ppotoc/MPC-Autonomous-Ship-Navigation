## Theory and Associated Paper

This project is based on the research paper:

Potoƒçnik, P. (2025). Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Ship Navigation with COLREG Compliance and Chart-Based Path Planning.
_Journal of Marine Science and Engineering._ [DOI link ‚Äì to be added when available]

Summary
The paper presents a novel control framework for autonomous ship navigation that integrates:

A nonlinear ship model with predictive control for trajectory optimization.

Real-time interpretation of COLREG collision avoidance rules.

Chart-based coastal path planning using publicly available geospatial datasets.

Robust performance in multi-agent scenarios with dynamic obstacle handling.

This simulator implements the theoretical concepts from the paper and provides a testbed for practical validation of the proposed approach.
